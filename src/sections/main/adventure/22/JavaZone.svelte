    This year JavaZone was a thing between the 7<small>th</small> and 8<small>th</small> of September!

    As usual, it acts more of a reunion-party than an actual conference! Got a few take-aways this year too, and my notes were mostly focused on
    dockerizing applications, and making stuff faster and leaner on both the JVM and by utilizing something else, such as go-lang.

    Looking forward to 2023!
